  <h2>What to Feed your Betta Fish</h2>
  <p>Betta fish have upturned mouths so they tend to feed on the water's surface. To give your betta a healthy diet, give it a mix of flake food, pellets, and freeze dried or frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp. This combination of food is great because it gives your betta many vitamins and minerals.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Be sure not to overfeed your betta! These fish have a greedy appetite and will always come up to the surface begging for food. At most, feed your betta either once or twice a day. This allows for a regular feeding time and portions out your betta's diet as well.</p>

  <h3>Flakes</h3>
  <p>Flakes are the most common and popular food people tend to buy for their betta. This popularity though is usually due to it's cheap price. Flake food is designed to include all the nutrition your fish needs, but they are less nutritious than fresh or live food. </p>



  <h3>Pellets</h3>
  <p>Pellets are an effective choice of food for bettas and can be used as a daily source of nutrition. This choice is usually higher quality compared to flake food. Pellets are similar in price to flake food, so if available at your local pet store, do strive for this option.</p>



  <h3>Freeze Dried or Frozen Food</h3>
  <p>Freeze dried and frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp are great options of protein and nutrition for your betta fish. This is because these are live food options. We would suggest not to feed this on the daily to your betta though. These types of food are often seen more as treats for your betta. Feed these to your betta every once or twice a week. </p>
