  <h3>Fish Tank</h3>
  <p>Generally, a betta should be kept in a tank 10 gallons or larger. If it is any smaller, your betta will not have a lot of room to swim around and live in. Take yourself for example, wouldn't you prefer to live in a bigger house than a small one.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When adding water to your tank, you must treat the water with a water conditioner before adding any fish to it. The reason being, tap water tends to have chemicals that are harmful to fish species. Water testing kits should be available at your local pet shop but it is not necessary as long as you treat your water with the conditioner. Before adding your fish to the tank, let the water in the tank cycle for a few days. This allows beneficial bacteria to grow, which is essential for breaking down the toxic ammonia once the fish are added.</p>



  <h3>Heater</h3>
  <p>Betta fish are tropical fish. They should be kept in waters around a temperature between 76 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit. For this reason, bettas should never be kept in a tank with fish who require colder water to be comfortable. The tank should be in a spot where temperature and light are constant and controllable. If possible, get a tank that already has a cover with LED lights. This allows a constant light and won't fluctuate the temperature of the water like if put next to a sunny window.</p>



  <h3>Filter</h3>
  <p>Filters are beneficial because you won't have to clean your tank as often. With a filter, it keeps the water in the tank moving and collects a lot of the waste build up. With the moving of the water, oxygen is constantly being pushed into the tank. Without a filter, you will have to do constant water changes on a daily basis. A reminder! Just because you have a filter does not mean you shouldn't do regular cleans. Overtime, there will still be algae build up in your tank.</p>

  <h3>Plants and Decorations</h3>
  <p>Plants and other tank decorations are a great addition to the tank. They are not necessary but they give the tank color and life. Fake plants are great for the aesthetics, but if possible and in your budget, try getting real plants. Real plants create oxygen in your tank, while they also stop algae from growing at a fast rate. In addition to that, real plants are softer on the fins of your betta. As their fins are so large and delicate, fake plants may have harsh edges that end up cutting and ruining your betta's fins.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you do decide to add decorations to your tank, try getting ones where your betta can rest it's fins upon or hide in. Just like you, bettas get tired and want a place to cuddle and hide every once in a while. Try looking into a betta leaf that you can attach to the side of your tank! Betta love to rest on these because even bettas like coming up to the surface of the water to catch a breath of air.</p>
