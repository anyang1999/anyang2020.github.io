  <h3 id="crown">Crowntail Betta</h3>
  <p>The Crowntail Betta is one of the most popular freshwater fish. The fins of this species have a long spikey crown appearance. While the males show bold, deep colors with long fins and tail, female bettas look quite different. Usually the female has lighter colors with a shorter tail.</p>


  <h3 id="veil">Veiltail Betta</h3>
  <p>This is another very common variation of tail type which is widely available. The male of this variation has a long, flowing downwards swooping tail. </p>


  <h3 id="half">Halfmoon Betta</h3>
  <p>The Halfmoon Betta has a large tail creating half a circle similar to the shape of a half moon. This type is strictly bred in captivity, so you won’t find them in the wild. These fish can be a bit challenging to breed and come with a more aggressive behavior.</p>

  <h3 id="plakat">Plakat Betta</h3>
  <p>Contrary to most betta fish, Plakat Bettas have short and round tails. They are almost the exception to the rule. Their fins are also quite short when compared to other variations. This betta type is considered the traditional form that would have been found in the wild.</p>

  <h3 id="double">Double Tail Betta</h3>
  <p>The Double Tail Betta is easily recognizable as it has two separate distinct tails. Usually, this variation has a larger and longer dorsal fin with a shorter body.</p>

  <h3 id="dumbo">Elephant Ear/Dumbo Betta</h3>
  <p>The Elephant Ear/Dumbo Betta is a very unique fish which doesn’t really fit into the tail category. Instead, it has unique pectoral fins. The name is given by the two pectoral fins resembling the ears of an elephant.</p>

  <h3 id="delta">Delta Tail Betta</h3>
  <p>The Delta Tail Betta has a rather large tail. It is named after the Greek letter d as the tail resembles the shape of the letter delta ∆.</p>

  <h3 id="rose">Rose Tail Betta</h3>
  <p>The Rose Tail Betta is a variation of the halfmoon where the total spread of the caudal fin is larger than 180°. It's fins are particularly branchy, giving it a similar look to a rose.</p>


  <h2 id="otherfeatures">Other Features</h2>
  <p>Other features that separate bettas into categories are based on their color and pattern. Bettas come in all sorts of colors! From red, blue, black, white, and so on. The patterns of bettas are interesting as a lot were created through the process of breeding. Some patterns are dragon scale, marble, koi, and more.</p>
