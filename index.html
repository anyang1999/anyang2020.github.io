  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Betta fish, otherwise known as Siamese fighting fish, are tropical, freshwater fish native to Asia. Betta fish are commonly found in the waters of Southeast Asia, more specifically the rivers of Cambodia and Thailand. The ones you see in pet stores are fairly different than those caught in the wild though. Bettas caught in the wild are often a more green and brown color with smaller fins, while the ones seen in stores are brighter in color and have large fins. This is due to the years of breeding betta fish. Breeding betta fish is a common practice in Thailand and because of the high demand of bettas on the fish market, are often kept in small bottles with little space to move. When transported to the U.S., the bettas are dumped into small plastic cups or bags waiting for shipment.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>For some background on betta fish, let's start for why they are known as the "fighting" fish. In the late 1800's, the King of Thailand took interest in these fish for their fighting and territorial instincts. Natives would collect and breed the fish specifically for fighting matches to entertain the King. These matches eventually turned into regular events and bets would even be placed on fights. Due to these reasons, the process of breeding betta fish has now grown into somewhat of a collectable for fish enthusiast.</p>
